            <p>Aside from its religious significance, Antipolo City is renowned for its breathtaking views of the Metro Manila skyline and the surrounding landscapes. Several spots, like the Pinto Art Museum and Cloud 9, offer visitors a chance to take in these panoramic views while appreciating art and nature.</p>

Antipolo’s Suman is mainly made from “Malagkit” (glutinous rice) and coconut milk (gata) and wrapped in a so-called “Kampil.” Others call it Ibos. Suman tastes best when dipped in latik (coconut jam) or sugar. </dd>

They claimed that Antipolo’s kasoy are the best tasting cashew nuts in the country, and the fact that so many people buy the product despite its high price proves that they have done justice to their claim. If you have “suki” (especially in Victory Pasalubong Center, which is right next to the Antipolo Cathedral), you might be able to get Kasoy at a discount. Kasoy is now available in more flavors, including garlic, adobo, and even barbeque. </dd>
